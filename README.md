# LCloud (LocalCloud)

## Project Objective & Scope

**LCloud** is an open-source initiative to bring AWS sandbox environments to a Kubernetes (K8s) platform, ideally running OnPremise. The goal is to enable zero-cost development environments that can later be integrated into CI/CD pipelines and deployed to AWS accounts seamlessly. LCloud will emulate AWS services using open-source technologies, allowing developers to use familiar AWS CLI commands and a web interface identical to AWS, while running everything locally.

### Motivation

- **Cost Reduction:** Avoid cloud expenses for development and testing environments.
- **Portability:** Make it easy to move workloads from local to AWS, reusing scripts and workflows.
- **Agility:** Enable early integration with CI/CD pipelines and automated deployments to AWS.

### Strategy

- **AWS CLI & UI Compatibility:** Users interact with services using AWS CLI and a web UI mimicking AWS Console.
- **Service Emulation:** Each AWS service is mapped to an open-source equivalent on K8s:
  - **Athena:** PrestoDB as the SQL engine.
  - **EC2:** KubeVirt for virtual machines.
  - **S3:** MinIO for object storage.
  - **Lambda:** OpenFaaS or Knative for serverless functions.
  - **VPC:** K8s CNI plugins for virtual networking.
  - **Glue:** Apache Airflow or Spark for ETL orchestration.
  - **LakeFormation:** Open-source data catalog and access control.
  - **AppSync:** Hasura or Apollo for GraphQL APIs.
  - **CloudFormation:** Crossplane or Pulumi for infrastructure as code.

### Initial Scope

- Start with Lambda, EC2, VPC, Athena, Glue, LakeFormation, S3, AppSync, and CloudFormation.
- Ensure each service is modular, integrable, and behaves like its AWS counterpart.
- Design for easy extension to more AWS services in the future.

### Integration & User Experience

- **CLI & Web UI:** AWS CLI compatibility and a familiar web interface.
- **CI/CD Ready:** Local environments can be plugged into CI/CD pipelines for automated AWS deployment.
- **Developer Friendly:** Reuse AWS scripts, templates, and workflows.
